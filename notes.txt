NEED TO FIX IN P2 PEER.C CODE:

- (ALL FUNCTIONS) fix multiple sends, need only one
	-> figure out how to create a packet with action and other data
	-> for strings and the NULL terminator:
		send(s, fname, strlen() + 1, 0) 
		*the + 1 accounts for the NULL
- (PUBLISH) account for fact that the file we're opening could have directories in them 
	-> readdir() tells whether what we're looking at is a file or directory
- (PUBLISH) save filename and count files in one go

FETCH FUNCTION: fetch a file from another peer and save it locally

(a) read a file name from the terminal,

(b) send a SEARCH request to the registry for the file,

(c) receive the peer information from the registry,

(d) send a FETCH request to the identified peer,

(e) and then receive and save the file information from the peer and save it to a file with the same name as the user requested in the local directory of the peer application.

ISSUES/PROCESS:

- how to send a search request from within the fetch function
